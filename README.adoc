= Asynchronous Event-driven Workflows with Jakarta EE

[abstract]
This repository is an example for asynchronous event-driven workflows with Jakarta EE. It demonstrates how to use JMS and EJB Message-Driven Bean in Jakarta EE to create a simple asynchronous event-driven workflow.



= System Requirements

= Build and run the example

- Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this project.

- Type this command to build and deploy the archive:

[source, sh, subs="+attributes"]
mvn clean package -P provisioned-server

- This will build a WAR file, download and provision a Wildfly server, and deploy the WAR file to the server (the fully configured server can be found in the `target/server` directory).

- Run the following command to start the server:

[source, sh, subs="+attributes"]
mvn wildfly:start

- Launch the demo-frontend at <http://localhost:8080>.

- Run the following command to stop the server:

[source, sh, subs="+attributes"]
mvn wildfly:shutdown
